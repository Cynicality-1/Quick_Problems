Here's the rules:
1. Halloween-themed
2. Program in any language (python, java, c, etc.)
3. Make it art-related
4. Use some sort of actual coding (don't just print out the whole design)
5. Submit your answer in a file called (your name).py
6. You can't use modules unless they are built-in modules/libraries
7. For more clarification on the rules, ask Shantanu
