Your goal is to create a program that creates some type of art related to Halloween. If you win, you'll get a bunch of candy (pictures of the candy are in the Google Classroom) or maybe a gift card. The contest finishes before our meeting on the 30th of October. At the meeting, people who entered the contest will show off their artwork and the code behind it. Here's the rules:
1. Halloween-themed
2. Program in any language (python, java, c, etc.)
3. Make it art-related
4. Use some sort of actual coding (don't just print out the whole design)
5. Submit your answer in a file called (your name).py
6. You can't use modules unless they are built-in modules/libraries
7. For more clarification on the rules, ask Shantanu
